# Learn R Language from Scratch
This repository contains programs that were written to understand and learn R language under R Programmming Lab.
Each folder represents an experiment. The experiment details are :
1. R Basics: 
    * Comments, 
    * variables, 
    * identifier, 
    * keywords, 
    * basic data types, 
    * type conversion, 
    * I/P & O/P statements, 
    * formatting output etc.
    * Program to calculate simple and compound interest.
    * Program to performs different conversions like temperature conversion, distance conversion etc. 
2. To study different Data Structures supported by R Programming.
3. To study different control structures and functions supported by R Programming.
    * Write a menu driven code which will read a number and should implement the following methods
        * factorial()
        * reverse()
        * testArmstrong()
        * testPalindrome()
        * testPrime()
    * Program to Display Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion
4. To study different import and export functions in R Programming.
5. To study Descriptive Statistics in R programming
6. To study Data manipulation and Transformation in R
7. To apply Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization on sample data.
8. To implement Correlation, Linear regression and Multiple regression on sample data set.
9. To implement Classification and Clustering algorithms using R programming.
